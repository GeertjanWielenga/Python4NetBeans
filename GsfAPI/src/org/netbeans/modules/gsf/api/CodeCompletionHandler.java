/**
 * Provide code completion for this language. This implementation
 * is responsible for all the analysis around the given caret offset.
 * A code completion provider should be smart and for example limit
 * alternatives not just by the given identifier prefix at the caret offset,
 * but also by the surrounding context; for example, if we're doing
 * code completion inside an expression that is part of a {@code return}
 * statement, the types should be limited by the return type of the current
 * method, and so on.
 *
 * A default SPI implementation is available that will perform some of this
 * analysis assuming it's applied to a parse tree using the other SPI default
 * implementation classes.
 *
 * @todo Instead of passing in caseSensitive, should I pass in a Comparator which should be used
 *   for determining eligibility? That way it's completely insulated from the clients
 * @todo Pass in completion mode such that I can do different stuff for smart-completion
 * @todo The result should indicate whether it has been filtered!
