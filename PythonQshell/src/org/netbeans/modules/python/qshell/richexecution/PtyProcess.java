 * A process being run connected to a Pty.

 * Use {@link PtyExecutor} or subclasses thereof to create a PtyProcess.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Closing of the Pty</h3>
 * One reason we pass in a Pty is so Ptyprocess can close it when the process
 * exits. The closing of the pty really only closes the slave side file
 * descriptor and that is neccessary so that any master side reader will see
 * an EOF.
 * <br>
 * Why not close the slave side right after the process is created?
 * <br>
 * Because apparently on solaris one can manipulate terminal characteristics,
 * like size changes, only from the slave side. But the key word here is
 * apparently. SHOULD experiment further.
