# {0} - parser error message
DESC_Problem_Broken_Config=The $project_basedir/nb-configuration.xml file cannot be parsed. The information contained in the file will be ignored until fixed. This affects several features in the IDE that will not work properly as a result.\n\n The parsing exception follows:\n{0}
DESC_Problem_Broken_Config2=The $project_basedir/nb-configuration.xml file contains some elements multiple times. That can happen when concurrent changes get merged by version control for example. The IDE however cannot decide which one to use. So until the problem is resolved manually, the affected configuration will be ignored.
