 * Information about where Java sources corresponding to binaries
 * (classfiles) can be found.
 * <p>
 * A default implementation is registered by the
 * <code>org.netbeans.modules.gsfpath.project</code> module which looks up the
 * project corresponding to the file (if any; <code>jar</code>-protocol URLs
 * actually check the owner of the JAR file itself) and checks whether that
 * project has an implementation of this interface in its lookup. If so, it
 * delegates to that implementation. Therefore it is not generally necessary
 * for a project type provider to register its own global implementation of
 * this query, if it depends on the Java Project module and uses this style.
 * </p>
 * <div class="nonnormative">
 * <p>
 * Note that if you supply a <code>SourceForBinaryQueryImplementation</code>
 * corresponding to an entry in a {@link org.netbeans.modules.gsfpath.spi.classpath.ClassPathProvider} for some source
 * files, there needs to be a {@link org.netbeans.modules.gsfpath.spi.classpath.ClassPathProvider} for the sources
 * used as dependencies as well. Otherwise code completion will not work well;
 * the current parser database creation strategy uses the following search order
 * when deciding what to parse for a binary classpath element:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The sources returned by <code>SourceForBinaryQueryImplementation</code>,
 *     <em>if</em> these have at least a bootclasspath specified as well by some
 *     {@link org.netbeans.modules.gsfpath.spi.classpath.ClassPathProvider}.</li>
 * <li>Compiled classes mixed into the "source" directory, if there are any.</li>
 * <li>Compiled classes in the binary classpath element.</li>
